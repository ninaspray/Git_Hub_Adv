    <h1>Git Quiz</h1>

    <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?</h4>
    <p>Git is a version control system. Git is a good way of tracking changes that have been made to our code. Git is
        also beneficial for making collaboration easier so multiple people can work on one project and their changes can
        be merged into one source. Git is essential to helping document and showcase your work.</p>
    <h4>What's a branch and why do we create them?</h4>
    <p>A branch creates a separate line of development. Branches are used advantageously when working on a separate /
        new feature of a project whilst not affecting the major branch. Branches are another pointer to commit. </p>
    <h4>What's the working tree?</h4>
    <p>The working tree is the directory that includes any subdirectories and files. When opening files for a project
        that is being managed by the girt repository you are then accessing the working tree.</p>
    <h4>What's the staging area?</h4>
    <p>The staging area is a draft space where you can upload changes of your work before commiting.</p>
    <h4>What's the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?</h4>
    <p>Git Pull. Fetch and download the updated content from the remote.</p>
